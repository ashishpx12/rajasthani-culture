                <b>1.Preparation:-</b>
                   - Obtain a Rajasthani Lattu, which is a conical wooden spinning top often adorned with colorful designs.
                   - Ensure you have a length of string (usually cotton or nylon) to spin the Lattu.
                
                <b>2.String Setup:-</b>
                   - Tie one end of the string securely around the axis of the Lattu. The string should be long enough to allow you to spin the Lattu comfortably.
                
                <b>3.Spinning :-</b>
                   - Hold the Lattu in your dominant hand with the string wrapped around it.
                   - Use your other hand to pull the string swiftly and firmly to start the spinning motion. This action will cause the Lattu to spin rapidly on its pointed bottom.
                
               <b>4.Maintaining the Spin:-</b> 
                   - As the Lattu spins, carefully manipulate the string with slight tugs or releases to adjust its balance and keep it spinning for as long as possible.
                
               <b>5.Tricks and Challenges:-</b> 
                   - Experiment with different surfaces to spin the Lattu on, such as the ground or a smooth tabletop.
                   - Try performing tricks like spinning the Lattu on one spot, making it jump, or knocking down obstacles.
                
                <b>6.Competitive Play:-</b>
                   - Engage in friendly competitions where players showcase their skills in spinning and performing tricks with the Lattu.
                   - Challenge others to see who can spin their Lattu the longest or perform the most impressive maneuvers.
                
              <b> 7.Enjoyment and Skill Development :-</b> 
                   - Rajasthani Lattu is not just a game but a cultural tradition that promotes hand-eye coordination, dexterity, and creativity.
                   - Embrace the joy of mastering this traditional pastime and appreciate its cultural significance within Rajasthan and beyond.
