        <div class="raj1"><img src="./images/gilli-danda.jfif" alt="">

            <p class="para">Gilli Danda is a traditional Indian game enjoyed by children and adults alike. It involves two main pieces of equipment: a small wooden stick called the "gilli" and a longer stick known as the "danda." The game begins with placing the gilli
                on the ground or any stable surface. The player then uses the danda to strike the gilli, attempting to hit it into the air. Points are scored based on the distance the gilli travels and how it lands. The player's objective is to strike
                the gilli skillfully and then catch it before it hits the ground. Gilli Danda is not only a fun outdoor activity but also promotes hand-eye coordination, concentration, and social interaction among players. It is a cherished part of Indian
                traditional games, fostering a sense of camaraderie and cultural heritage. </p>

            the danda and should be easy to handle.

        </p>
        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; padding-top: 23px; margin-bottom: 27px">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; ">2.Setup :-</sup>Find a flat and open area, preferably outdoors, where you have enough space to play without obstacles. Mark a starting point where players take turns.

        </p>
        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; padding-top: 23px; margin-bottom: 27px">

        </p>
        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; padding-top: 23px; margin-bottom: 27px">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; ">5. Score Points :-</sup> Points are scored based on how far the gilli travels and how it lands. Players can agree on specific rules for scoring beforehand, such as points for distance or style.
        </p>
        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; padding-top: 23px; margin-bottom: 27px">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; ">6. Catch the gilli :-</sup> After hitting the gilli, the player must catch it with the same end of the danda used to hit it before it touches the ground.

        </p>
        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; padding-top: 23px; margin-bottom: 27px">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; ">7. Take Turns :-</sup> Players take turns hitting and catching the gilli. The player who scores the most points or reaches a predetermined score wins the game.
