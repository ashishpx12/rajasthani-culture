            <p class="para" style="width:50%;">Satoliya, also known as Seven Tiles or Seven Stones, is a traditional Indian game played outdoors. It involves two teams, each aiming to knock down seven flat stones or tiles placed in a line using a thrown ball, typically a soft one like
                a tennis ball. The throwing team scores points based on the number of tiles successfully knocked down before defenders retrieve the ball and tag them. Players must exhibit throwing accuracy and strategic teamwork while the defending team
                showcases agility and quick reflexes to prevent scoring. After each turn, roles switch between throwing and defending teams. Satoliya not only promotes physical activity and coordination but also fosters camaraderie and competitive spirit
                among players. It remains a beloved pastime, preserving cultural heritage and encouraging outdoor play in communities across India and beyond.</p>

            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">1.Gather Players :-</sup> Choose a suitable playing area, usually a flat surface outdoors. Decide on the number of players, usually two teams with an equal number of players
            on each side.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">2.Arrange the Tiles/Stones :-</sup> Place seven flat stones or tiles (hence the name Seven Tiles) in a straight line, about 1-2 feet apart from each other.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">3.Decide the Order :-</sup> One team is chosen to start the game. The opposing team waits to play defense.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">4. Throwing the Ball :-</sup> A soft ball or a similar object (like a tennis ball) is thrown by a player from the starting team towards the arrangement of tiles/stones.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">5. Knocking Down Tiles :-</sup> The objective for the throwing team is to knock down the tiles with the ball. Each tile knocked down counts as a point.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">6.Defense :-</sup> Players from the defending team try to retrieve the ball quickly and tag the players of the throwing team before they can rebuild the tiles.
        </p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">7.Scoring :-</sup> The throwing team scores points based on the number of tiles knocked down before being tagged by the defenders. If all tiles are knocked down successfully
            without being tagged, the team scores the maximum points.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">8.Rebuilding Tiles :-</sup> After a turn (whether successful or not), the defending team rebuilds the tiles in their original positions for the next round.
        </p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">9.Switching Sides :-</sup> Once the throwing team is tagged or their turn ends, roles switch. The defenders become the throwers, and vice versa.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">10.Winning the Game :-</sup> The game continues for a predetermined number of rounds or until a team reaches a specified score. The team with the highest score at the end
            of the game wins.
