            <p class="para" style="width:50%;">Teer Andazi, also known as archery or arrow shooting, is a traditional sport and recreational activity widely practiced in various cultures worldwide, including India, where it holds cultural significance. Participants use a bow to shoot arrows
                at a designated target, aiming for accuracy and precision. Historically, archery has roots in hunting and warfare but has evolved into a competitive sport and leisure activity. In modern times, teer andazi is practiced both competitively
                and for recreation, often involving skilled archers who compete in tournaments or simply enjoy the discipline of improving their aim and technique. The sport not only promotes physical fitness, focus, and hand-eye coordination but also
                preserves cultural traditions and fosters a sense of community among enthusiasts. Teer andazi continues to thrive as a celebrated pastime that connects people through its blend of skill, tradition, and camaraderie.

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">2.Find a Suitable Location:-</sup> Choose a safe and designated archery range or area with sufficient space for shooting targets. Ensure there are no obstructions or people
            in the shooting path.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">3.Prepare the Bow:-</sup> String the bow properly according to manufacturer instructions. Check that the bow limbs are in good condition and securely attached.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">4.Prepare the Arrows:-</sup> Inspect each arrow for any defects or damage. Attach arrowheads securely if using detachable points. Ensure all arrows are of appropriate length
            and weight for your bow.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">5.Take Proper Shooting Stance:-</sup> Stand perpendicular to the target with feet shoulder-width apart. Place one foot slightly ahead of the other (dominant foot back for
            most shooters). Grip the bow handle firmly but not too tightly.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">6.Nock the Arrow:-</sup> Place the arrow on the bowstring between the nocking point and the arrow rest (or shelf). Ensure the arrow is seated correctly with the index feather
            (or vane) facing away from the bow.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">7.Draw the Bow:-</sup> Extend your bow arm toward the target while using your other hand to draw the string smoothly and steadily to your anchor point (usually near the
            corner of the mouth or chin).</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">8.Aim and Release:-</sup> Use your dominant eye to aim along the arrow shaft or through the bow sight if equipped. Focus on the target and release the string smoothly by
            relaxing your fingers or using a release aid.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">9.Follow Through:-</sup> Maintain your aiming position and posture after releasing the arrow. This helps ensure consistency and accuracy in your shots.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">10.Retrieve Arrows:-</sup> Once shooting is complete, approach the target carefully to retrieve arrows. Ensure others are clear of the shooting line before collecting arrows.

            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">11.Practice Safety:-</sup> Always follow archery safety rules, including never pointing a loaded bow at anyone, maintaining a safe shooting distance, and wearing appropriate

            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">12.Enjoy and Improve:-</sup> Archery is both a sport and a skill that improves with practice. Enjoy the process of refining your technique and aiming for greater accuracy
