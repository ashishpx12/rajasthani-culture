            <p class="para" style="width:50%;">Kabaddi is a traditional contact sport that originated in ancient India and is popular across South Asia. It is played between two teams, with each team attempting to score points by raiding the opponent's territory and tagging as many defenders
                as possible without being tackled or running out of breath. The game requires agility, strength, and strategic thinking. A raider, chanting "kabaddi kabaddi," enters the opponent's half and must touch one or more defenders while holding
                their breath. If the raider successfully returns to their own half without being tackled, they earn points for their team. Defenders try to stop the raider by tackling or holding them, while the raider tries to escape their grasp. Kabaddi
                promotes physical fitness, teamwork, and quick decision-making skills. It is celebrated in tournaments and leagues, showcasing cultural pride and sporting excellence. </p>
