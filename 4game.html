            <p class="para" style="width:50%;">Langdi, also known as "hopscotch," is a traditional outdoor game popular in India and other parts of the world. Played by children, it involves drawing a pattern of numbered squares on the ground, usually with chalk, and players hop through
                the squares to retrieve a marker or stone thrown into them. The game typically requires balance, agility, and quick thinking as players hop on one leg to complete the sequence without touching the lines or losing balance. Langdi promotes
                physical fitness, coordination, and social interaction among participants. It is not only a recreational activity but also a cultural tradition passed down through generations, fostering camaraderie and competitive spirit among children.
                Despite the advent of digital entertainment, Langdi continues to thrive as a cherished outdoor pastime, connecting children to their cultural heritage while encouraging outdoor play and physical exercise.

            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">1. Draw the Grid :-</sup> Use chalk or draw lines on the ground to create a grid of numbered squares. Traditionally, the grid has seven squares in a row.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">2. Select Players :-</sup> Decide on the number of players. Typically, there are two teams, but it can vary.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">3. Choose a Denner :-</sup> One player is chosen as the "Denner" or "Langdi" who stands in the center of the grid. Their goal is to tag players from the opposing team.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">4. Start the Game :-</sup> The game begins when the Denner calls out a number from 1 to 7. Players from the opposing team must hop on one leg to reach that numbered square
            and return without being tagged by the Denner.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">5. Hop on One Leg :-</sup> Players must hop on one leg throughout the game. If a player uses both legs or loses balance, they are out for that round.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">6. Avoid Being Tagged :-</sup> Players must evade the Denner's attempts to tag them while hopping through the grid.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">7. Score Points :-</sup> Points are scored by successfully hopping to and from the announced square without being tagged. Each successful round scores a point for the hopping
            team.
        </p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">8. Switch Roles :-</sup> After a set number of rounds or points, roles may switch, with the Denner and hopping teams changing places.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">9. End of Game :-</sup> The game typically continues until a predetermined score or time limit is reached. The team with the most points at the end wins.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">10. Have Fun :-</sup> Langadi is not just about winning but also about having fun, improving balance, coordination, and enjoying outdoor play with friends.</p>
