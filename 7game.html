            <p class="para" style="width:50%;">Ashta Chamma is a traditional board game popular in South India, particularly in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. It is played on a cross-shaped board with 8 squares, hence its name "Ashta Chamma" (Ashta
                meaning eight and Chamma meaning move). Each player has four pawns, and the objective is to move all pawns from one's own home square to the central square and then to the opponent's home squares, in a counter-clockwise direction. Players
                roll dice or cowrie shells to determine the number of moves. If a pawn lands on a square occupied by an opponent's pawn, the opponent's pawn is sent back to its home square. The game requires strategy, anticipation, and a bit of luck.
                Ashta Chamma is not just a game of skill but also a cultural symbol, often played during festivals and family gatherings, fostering social interaction and bonding among players.

        <h1 class=" abth2 ">steps to play ashta-chamma</h1>


        <div class="para-1">

            <p><pre style="font-size: 1.6rem;">

        <b>1.setup :-</b>
                - Place the Ashta Chamma board on a flat surface between the players.
                - Each player chooses a color and places their four pawns on their
                    respective home squares, usually marked with a distinct color or symbol.
                
        <b>2.Determining the First Player:</b>
                - Players typically roll dice or use cowrie shells to 
                   determine who goes first. The player with the higher roll starts the game.
                
        <b>3.Movement:-</b> 
                - On your turn, roll the dice or cowrie shells.
                - Move one of your pawns based on the number rolled in a
                    counter-clockwise direction.
                - You must use the exact number rolled to move a pawn, unless
                    you roll a 1 or 8, which have special rules:
                - Rolling a 1 allows you to move any pawn out of your home square.
                - Rolling an 8 allows you to move a pawn into the center square.
                
        <b>4.Capturing:-</b>
                - If you land on a square occupied by an opponent's pawn (except on a safe 
                   square), capture that pawn.
                - The captured pawn is sent back to its home square, and you take another 
                   turn.
                
        <b>5.Entering and Moving Out of Center:-</b> 
                 - To enter the center square, you must roll the exact number required.
                 - Once in the center square, you move your pawns towards your opponent's 
                   home squares based on subsequent rolls.
                
        <b>6.Winning the Game :-</b> 
                - The first player to successfully move all four of their pawns into their 
                   opponent's home squares wins the game.
                
        <b>7. Special Rules :-</b>
                - There are additional rules for doubles (rolling two of the same number), 
                   which might allow you to move twice.
                - Safe squares (usually the center square) cannot be captured upon.
                - Variations may include specific rules for reaching the center or for 
                   captures.
