            <p class="para" style="width:50%;">Pachisi, originating in ancient India around the 6th century AD, is a revered board game steeped in history and strategy. Played on a cross-shaped board with typically 68 or 72 squares, it involves each player maneuvering four pawns from a
                starting point to a home base, often marked at the end of one arm of the board. Players roll dice or cowrie shells to determine moves, balancing luck with strategic decision-making. Special squares on the board add complexity, offering
                safe zones or opportunities for additional moves. Pachisi, enjoyed by Indian royalty and nobility historically, reflects traditional values of patience, calculation, and social interaction. Today, its modern variant, Ludo, simplifies rules
                while preserving the game's core mechanics, making it a popular choice for family gatherings and recreational play worldwide. Pachisi remains a cultural treasure, bridging generations with its timeless appeal and rich cultural significance.</p>

            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">4. Special Moves :-</sup> - Rolling a 6 grants an extra turn after moving a pawn. - Pawns can be moved onto special squares, such as safe squares or the starting point of
            an opponentâ€™s pawn, which captures that pawn.</p>

            point.

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">6. Entering Home :-</sup> - Pawns need an exact roll to enter the "home column, " the final arm of the cross-shaped board leading to the center. - Once in the home column,
            exact rolls are not required; excess can be used for other pawns.</p>

        <p class="para2 " style="width: 86%; ">
            <sup style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 27px ">7. Winning :-</sup> - The first player to move all four pawns into their respective home bases (located at the end of their arm of the cross) wins the game.
